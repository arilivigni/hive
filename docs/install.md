# Installing Hive

## Installing Community Release via OperatorHub

Hive is published to [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/operator/hive-operator) weekly and this is the best method to install and use Hive if you do not need to build from source.

  1. Create a 'hive' namespace.
  1. In OpenShift web console navigate to Administrator perspective > Operators > OperatorHub.
  1. Search for “hive” and select the OpenShift Hive operator.
     1. Select the “alpha” update channel, install to a specific namespace, select the “hive” namespace just created, approval strategy automatic, and press Install.
     1. You should now have a hive-operator pod running in the hive namespace.
  1. Create a HiveConfig to trigger the the actual deployment of Hive. (can be done via the web UI with a couple clicks, or with oc apply)

```yaml
apiVersion: hive.openshift.io/v1
kind: HiveConfig
metadata:
  name: hive
spec:
 logLevel: debug
 targetNamespace: hive
```

The hive-operator pod should now deploy the remaining components (hive-controllers, hive-clustersync, hiveadmission), and once running Hive is now ready to begin accepting ClusterDeployments.

## Deploy From Source

See [developer instructions](developing.md)

# Verify that Hive is running

Run: `$ oc get pods -n hive`

Sample output:

```bash
$ oc get pods -n hive
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hive-clustersync-0                  1/1     Running   0          16m
hive-controllers-6fcbf74864-hdn27   1/1     Running   0          17m
hive-operator-7b877b996b-ndlpj      1/1     Running   0          17m
hiveadmission-7969fd9dd-l24jb       1/1     Running   0          17m
hiveadmission-7969fd9dd-pl2ml       1/1     Running   0          17m
```
